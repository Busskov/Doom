This game shows a simple 3D version for the game. 
The walls can be any convex shape, but the opponents are just balls. 
Presenting the opponents in the form of balls turned out to be the most successful solution. 
In many ways, this representation is boring, but it allows you to draw the most realistic monsters...
...if you need to keep within 100 lines of code:)
